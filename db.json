Your child will develop an understanding of four areas: physical sciences; life sciences; earth and space sciences\n\n\nPhysical Sciences\n\nThe physical sciences involve the study of the physical world. This includes chemistry, physics, and astronomy. Sometimes the Earth sciences are included in physical sciences since they are part of the physical world.\n\n\nEarth and Space Sciences\n\nThe Earth sciences involve the study of everything relating to the Earth, except for living things. These sciences include mainly geology and meteorology and sometimes geography. As they learn about the earth, children will learn about the characteristics of the earth's environments (mountains, rivers, oceans, valleys, and deserts) and the four seasons. They'll study the weather, daytime, nighttime, the different phases of the moon, and resources and conservation.\n\n\nLife Sciences\n\nThe life sciences are the study of living things. That includes biology, botany, zoology, and ecology, among others. As part of their study of the life sciences, children will learn the basic structures of common plants and animals (arms, legs, wings, leaves, stems, roots, etc.). They also may learn about the differences and similarities in plants and animals. Life science also allows kids to explore how living things adapt to their environment, grow, change and have certain needs. They may even explore how living things and non-living things differ or how they impact one another."

Pablo Picasso famously said, “Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up.” \n\nOne of the best ways to encourage a lifelong love of the arts is to enroll your kids in art classes. \n\nOR\n\nOne of the most basic benefits of art classes, particularly for toddlers, is the improvement of fine and gross motor skills. Because there are so many different types of art – from painting to sculpture to drawing – a variety of tools and techniques are required. For many small children, the struggle is real when it comes to using and developing their tiny muscles to hold and use objects correctly. Art classes teach children how to properly hold a paintbrush, pencils or markers and build hand muscles while playing with clay. Older students will benefit by learning proper painting or drawing techniques, and even build muscle when learning to create more physically-demanding forms of art like sculptures."

Worshipping was the main aim. Although every dance form evolved from different regions, their roots are the same. The roots can be traced from the Sanskrit text – ‘Natya Shastra’. \n\nUnlike folk dances, classical dances are all about technicalities and strict rules. Acharya Nandikeshawara’s ‘Abhinaya Darpan’ and Sharangdev’s ‘Sangeeth Ratnakar’ (Nartanadhyaya), along with the Natya \n\nShastra forms the foundation of technicalities of all the classical dance forms (which includes their body movements, rasa, bhava etc)."
